Small project to play around with:
* ReactJS
* WP REST API

I use this SPA to track movies I'm interested in watching or movies I've already watched. Movie information and images are fetched from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

This project can be seen at https://cine.robr.app?auth=visitor (with the visitor auth, you can only view movies and search for movies by title).

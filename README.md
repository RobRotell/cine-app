Small project to play around with:
# ReactJS
# WP REST API

I use this SPA to track movies I'm interested in watching or movies I've already watched. Movie information and images are fetched from The Movie Database.

This project can be seen at https://cine.robr.app?auth=visitor (with the visitor auth, can only view movies and search for movies by title).
